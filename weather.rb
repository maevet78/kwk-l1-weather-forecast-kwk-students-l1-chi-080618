# Your methods should take in a hash as an argument - here's an example of what the hash will look like - the methods should take this hash as an argument and return the desired output. 

weather = {
	:city => "New York",
	:description => "Partly Cloudy",
	:temperature_farenheit => 66.3
}

# 1. Complete the method below called location, that accepts a hash called weather as an argument so that it returns the value of city from the weather hash. 
def location(weather)
	return weather[:city]
end
puts location(weather)


# 2. Using the location method as a guide, write a  method called "description" so it returns the description from the weather hash. 
def description(weather)
  return weather[:description]
end
puts description(weather)


# 3. Using the methods above and string interpolation, update the method below so that it returns a string that describes the current weather - for example: "The weather in New York is Partly Cloudy. The temperature is 66.1 degrees Farenheit." HINT: the method should RETURN the string, not print it to the terminal. 
 def weather_report(weather) 
  "The weather in #{weather[:city]} is #{weather[:description]}. The temperature is #{weather[:temperature_farenheit]} degrees Farenheit."
end  
puts weather_report(weather)

#4. Write a method that takes in the weather hash as an argument. 
# You'll want to use the each method to iterate over the hash and print out
# `The city is New York.` `The description is Partly Cloudy.` `The temperature is 66.3.`
def city_weather_info(weather)
  weather.each do |keys,values|
    puts "The #{keys} is #{values}."
  end  
end
city_weather_info(weather)


# BONUS:  Write a method that takes in the weather hash as an argument and converts the farenheit temperature to celcius. Have the method round your answer to two decimal places. Is there a method we can use to round in Ruby?
def convert_temp(weather)
  x = weather[:temperature_farenheit] - 32.0
  celsius = x * (5.0/9.0)
  celsius = celsius.round(2)
  puts "The temperature in celsius is #{celsius}°C."
end 

puts convert_temp(weather)
# Hint - how can we find the algorithm to convert Farenheit to Celsius?
